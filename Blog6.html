                <br>The Indigenous Peoples (IPs) in Mindanao, Philippines, have long faced complex
                challenges rooted in historical, social, and economic factors. This essay explores the
                phenomenon of second-order minoritization experienced by IPs in Mindanao, focusing on how
                they are treated by both Muslim communities and settlers.
                <br><br>Mindanao has been a melting pot of diverse cultures and communities, with IPs
                inhabiting the region long before the arrival of Muslim and Christian settlers. Historical narratives
                often highlight clashes over land and resources, contributing to a complex tapestry of
                relationships. Understanding this historical context is crucial for comprehending the
                second-order minoritization of IPs.
                <br><br>1. Land Disputes: Land has been a central issue in the relationship between IPs and
                Muslim communities. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Moro National Liberation
                Front (MNLF), two major Muslim rebel groups, have sought autonomy in Mindanao, leading to
                conflicts over ancestral lands. IPs, such as the Lumad communities, often find themselves
                caught in the crossfire of these disputes, resulting in displacement and loss of their traditional
                territories.
                <br><br>2. Land Encroachment: Settlers, often driven by economic opportunities, have migrated
                to Mindanao and encroached upon IP ancestral lands. This encroachment has resulted in the
                displacement of IPs and the disruption of their traditional way of life. The government's
                promotion of agricultural expansion and infrastructure development has further exacerbated
                these challenges.
                <br><br>In conclusion, the second-order minoritization of IPs in Mindanao is a multifaceted issue.
                While steps have been taken to address these challenges, ongoing efforts are required to
                ensure the fair and equitable treatment. The path towards a more inclusive Mindanao requires
                collaborative efforts from all communities involved, fostering understanding, respect, and shared
                development.
